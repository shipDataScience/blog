title: Announcing the Most Overbuilt Beta Ever!
---

After 6 months+ in the lab,
Ship Data Science is now open for beta business.
If you want in on the action, send us an [email](mailto:info@shipdatascience.com).

Because we're bringing the science of model monitoring to a whole new class of businesses, 
we expect a lot of questions like:
 
 - [What do you do?](https://www.shipdatascience.com/docs/getting-started/about)
 - [Why should I care?](https://www.shipdatascience.com/docs/science/monitoring#whymonitor)
 - [Got any examples?  ](https://www.shipdatascience.com/docs/ecosystem/projects#examples)

If we missed a burning question, don't be shy. Shoot us a [note](mailto:info@shipdatascience.com) for more info!
