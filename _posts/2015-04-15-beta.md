title: Private Beta++, Now taking signups!
---

After over 6 months in the lab,
Ship Data Science is now open for private beta business outside of our early testing community.
We're targeting this release to friends, startups and businesses in the San Francisco Bay Area.
If your company wants in on the action, send us an [email](mailto:info@shipdatascience.com)
and we'll greenlight an account for you. 

Because we're bringing the science of model monitoring to a whole new class of businesses, 
we expect a lot of questions like:
 
 - [What do you do?](https://www.shipdatascience.com/docs/getting-started/about)
 - [Why should I care?](https://www.shipdatascience.com/docs/science/monitoring#whymonitor)
 - [Got any examples?  ](https://www.shipdatascience.com/docs/ecosystem/projects#examples)

If you have a burning question that's not in the docs, don't be shy. Shoot over a [note](mailto:info@shipdatascience.com) for more info!
