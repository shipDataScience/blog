title: Yet more new stuff!
---

Big week this one! Check out the sweet new features:

 * Github Webhooks now available in project settings!
 * Brand-spanking new project summary page with lots of info-tastic goodies!
 * Branches are now first-class citizens throughout the experience!
 * Account page redesign!
 * Project page redesign!
 * Project settings redesign!
 * Mailers for account essentials---with a whole notification center on the way!

Things are looking good and we hope to have something for the public soon.

Happy hacking!
