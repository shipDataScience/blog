title: INCEPTION - Why start Ship Data Science? 
---

Welcome to the first blog post ever for my project, Ship Data Science.

I'm going to kick things off by asking you an insulting question.

Do you think a machine could do a better job running your business than you?

To cut the tension, the answer is, almost definitely not! There is an immense amount of complexity in running even the most
simple business, from adjusting strategy to keep abreast of a changing market, to reacting to new opportunities
and managing key relationships. Even deciding what problem to solve would be
a huge challenge.

But over the early 2000's, some companies that asked that question created **massive business empires** by turning
over small, bite-size but high-impact pieces of strategy to machine learning algorithms. 
Did you miss it? Check out some examples:

  - Capital One built the first profitable subprime credit card markets from 'information based strategy';
    a process of data-driven learning that culminated in one of the industry's most profitable credit businesses,
    and powerful automated models to drive lending decisioning and valuation for the business.
  - Google turned internet search results over to an increasingly-advanced series of search algorithms,
    starting with the humble but revolutionary pagerank and diversifying into intention-detection algorithms. The massive
    quality increase resulted in winning the lion's share of the $10bn++ search advertising market.
  - LinkedIn rolled out a recommendations product suggesting users connect with people they may know, resulting in an 
    step-change in the connection, engagement, and popularity of their site during the critical early growth period of the company.
  - Netflix built recommendation algorithms so powerful they are able to roll the algorithm's input forward into
    content acquisition planning, even having computers help evaluate show pilot's.

If you've ever worked at a company that runs its business around a few statistical models,
you know the tremendous opportunity that they create---but also the tremendous risk they introduce.

  - Hillary Clinton's campaign trusted election models predicting a large margin of victory and a 'firewall' in 
    midwestern states that never materialized.
  - Mortgage default models built prior to 2007 had never seen data from markets where house prices fell dramatically---
    an effect that turned out to step-change defaults due to mortgages going 'underwater'--- 
    removing the easy out for homeowners to simply sell an appreciating home for a higher value 
    and exit the mortgage when payments got too expensive.
  - It's not uncommon for startups building recommendation products to accidentally flip the sign on the recommender scores 
    due to engineering error, resulting in 'anti-recommenders' that crater customer conversion.
  - Tragically, self-driving car technology is not perfect, and there have already been human casualties from algorithmic 
    screw-ups.

So you can't just turn the keys of business over to machines, at least not yet---but it's generally very valuable to 
use them in a limited extent. 

Managing statistical models in production is complex and depends on:

  - Is the world stable?
  - Are the relationships my model uses changing?
  - Is the model still predicting well?
  - How could the model be improved?

Answering these questions in the past has been a deep-dive analysis that generally runs 
a few times a year and requires time from data scientists. 

However, the techniques that are used to determine if models are working or breaking down
are portable across most modeling applications; creating the classic value proposition for 
a platform---one global, vetted implementation for the metrics that really matter, and 
significantly reduced speed to market and costs compared to ad hoc efforts.
